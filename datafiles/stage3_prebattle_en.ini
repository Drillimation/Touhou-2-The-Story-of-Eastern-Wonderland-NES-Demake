0="Where the heck are we?"
1="This is Genmukai, the gap between the Aetherworld and Earth."
2="And don't worry, this ain't outer space; we can breathe just fine here."
3="I wasn't really worried about that..."
4="This is the quickest route to Reimaden."
5="The enemies here are tough..."
6="Whatever do you mean? I see somebody up ahead!"
7="Oh geez, already?"
8="Heyo!"
9="Are you overwhelmed too much?"
10="Why, yeah. But who are you?"
11="I'm Kagami Ochiai, a youkai from the future."
12="Does this have anything to do with the status of my shrine?"
13="No, but it concerns what's in front of you."
14="Are you an enemy!? And besides, how far into the future are you from?"
15="A month, year, or ten years?"
16="Around 300. 317 years to be exact."
17="317!? Are you kidding me!?"
18="What happens to Gensokyo at that time? You didn't destroy my shrine again, did you?"
19="No. But someone from several generations ahead of you becomes its shrine maiden."
20="Oh, man. A plumber dressed in red will one day kick my Gramps' shell around."
21="What!? My lifespan is pretty much close to its end."
22="Anyway, gotta go. See ya!"
