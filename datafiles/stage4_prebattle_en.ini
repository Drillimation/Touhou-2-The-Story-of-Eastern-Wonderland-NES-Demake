1="Indeed. I feel something overwhelming."
2="Perhaps we have found the leader at last."
3="It's kind of familiar though. But..."
4="What is it?"
5="Could the one behind all this really be..."
6="Wait, what!?"
7="I see her just ahead!"
8="Fancy meeting you here, Reimu."
9="I knew it was you, Mima."
10="You did?"
11="Nope, I had no idea. I've been wanting to try saying that."
12="More importantly, you were the one who destroyed my shrine, weren't you?"
13="Oh, who cares about some cheap-o old shrine in the middle of nowhere?"
14="My goal is vengeance against the entire human race!"
15="Well, I suppose it's fine to dream big."
16="Uhh..."
17="But I can't forgive you for busting up the shrine!"
18="I will seal you away for good!"
19="Hmph, a challenge! But I'm afraid I just don't have the time."
20="The hour of my restoration is nearly at hand! So, until then..."
21="Please let my daughter do this with you. See ya!"
22="Hey, wait, dang it!"
23="Don't worry, I've got this."
24="Can you please get out of the way?"
25="Oho! And let you chase my dead mother Mima? No thank you!"
26="I'll keep you entertained for an hour right here."
27="I guess I can just beat you up during that time..."
28="You think I'd lose to a half-baked magician like you?"
29="Bring it on!"
30="Stay calm, mistress. She may be dangerous."
31="Don't worry, I can do the job in no time!"
32="I hope so."
