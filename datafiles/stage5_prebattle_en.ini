1="Hmph. Well played."
2="I'm gonna get you this time!"
3="Oho! You're too late. I wonder just how well you yield your power."
4="And yes, you are truly the heir to the Hakurei Clan."
5="Eh?"
6="Very well then. I shall have a stake of your power and those orbs."
7="What are you trying to say?"
8="Only a blood member of the Hakurei Clan can use the Yin-Yang orbs."
9="They're shaped by its wielder's power and feed off of it."
10="Once they absorb enough, they release it in a single massive burst."
11="Be it for good or for the ill..."
12="They then return to normal and begin to absorb it once more."
13="So, that power is what you're after?"
14="Of course! It doesn't matter now though."
15="But it's nothing. More imporantly, Reimu."
16="You came here to defeat me, right?"
17="Correct. As the Hakurei Shrine's shrine maiden,"
18="it is my duty to seal you away for good."
19="Hmhm, that's the spirit! And very well, I won't hold back!"
20="Repeat, I won't hold back!"
