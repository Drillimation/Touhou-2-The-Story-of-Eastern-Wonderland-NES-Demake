***Touhou 2: The Story of Eastern Wonderland*** was originally released for the PC-98 by Team Shanghai Alice in 1997. Drillimation Systems, the developer best known for the *Chuhou Joutai* series, ported the game to PC in the style of an NES game using the GameMaker engine in 2020. It is the second game in the highly popular Touhou Project series and is the first danmaku shooter in the entire franchise.

Reimu Hakurei, the series' mascot, is the sole playable character in this game. The Hakurei Shrine has been shrouded in monsters, leading to Reimu piloting Genji (who is in this game an elderly Koopa Troopa) to seek out who started this. Marisa Kirisame, a magician who acts as the stage 4 boss, was introduced in this game and would become a playable character in every *Touhou Project* game after that.

*The Story of Eastern Wonderland* wasn't known to many players until the NES demake port released. Before that, *Touhou 6: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil* is the game that formally introduced most players to the *Touhou Project* franchise. As a result of the demake, the game is now playable on modern machines without the need to configure an emulator.

## About this repository
In 2023, Drillimation released the source code for the game. This repository is intended for GameMaker users wanting to develop their own retro style *Touhou Project* fangame or danmaku shooter, or to improve upon its flaws.
